# LED Dimmer with Arduino:
Creating an LED dimmer using an Arduino Uno is a great way to get hands-on with basic electronics and programming. This project involves using Pulse Width Modulation (PWM) to control the brightness of an LED. Here’s a step-by-step guide to setting up and programming an LED dimmer with an Arduino Uno:

## Components:
  - Arduino Board
  - LED
  - Resistor(220 ohm)
  - 10kΩ potentiometer (to adjust the brightness)
  - Breadboard 
  - Jumper Wires

## Instructions
Steps to Build the Circuit
### 1.Connect the LED and Resistor:
  - Connect the anode (long leg) of the LED to a 330Ω resistor.
  - Connect the other end of the resistor to pin 9 on the Arduino.
  - Connect the cathode (short leg) of the LED to the GND pin on the Arduino.

### 2.Connect the Potentiometer:
  - Connect the middle pin (wiper) of the potentiometer to analog pin A0 on the Arduino.
  - Connect one of the outer pins of the potentiometer to the 5V pin on the Arduino.
  - Connect the other outer pin of the potentiometer to the GND pin on the Arduino.
### 3.Adjust the Brightness:

  - Rotate the potentiometer to change the voltage it supplies to the analog pin.
  - This change in voltage will adjust the PWM signal sent to the LED, effectively dimming or brightening the LED.
